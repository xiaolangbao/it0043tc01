                <p class="description">Jollibee is a large red human-sized bee with red and yellow stripes. He has big black
                    eyes, a red tuxedo with a black bowtie, a white chef hat, and large yellow shoes. Jollibees wings are
                    clear white. Back in his earliest appearance in 1978, he had green wings and pants, and black shoes. His
                    undershirt was also orange and he had thin antennae. Most notably, he had a sting, which was never seen again. After being
                    redesigned by Willie Villano in the early 1980s, his head became a little wider, his body became a
                    little slender, and he was colored a lighter shade of red, somewhat like red orange.</p>

                <p class="description">Yum is an average-sized boy with light skin, dark brown hair, and brown eyes. Since his
                    redesign in 2008, he wears a hamburger-shaped baseball cap, yellow goggles, a purple shirt with blue and
                    orange sleeves with his name in the center, a black bag in his waist, green cargo pants, and blue and white
                    sneakers. The initial design character, back when he was called Mr. Yum, is portrayed as an adult postman
                    with black
                    eyes and hair. His burger hat was shaped like a fedora, and he wore a dark blue business suit and pants, a
                    white undershirt, and a red necktie. Around the middle 1990s, his blue suit was recolored into light yellow,
                    and a single blue suspender now holds his pants.</p>
